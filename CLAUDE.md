## About this project
- This is a Sunburn Timer application that calculates safe sun exposure based on your skin type, weather conditions, and protection level.

## Package Management
- Always use bun install for package management

## Development Approach
- Search web for established patterns before implementing complex custom solutions
- Use native web APIs over custom implementations when available
- Prefer platform defaults over manual calculations
- Use `useLayoutEffect` for DOM measurements to prevent timing issues

## Code Style
- Prefer Tailwind classes over inline styles when available
- Simplify overly complex logic - step back and use simpler approaches
- Follow React Rules of Hooks - never call hooks inside loops
